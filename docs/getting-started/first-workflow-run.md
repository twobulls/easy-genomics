# Your first workflow run

This guide walks you through the core Easy Genomics journey after deployment: sign in, set up an organization and lab,
connect AWS HealthOmics or Seqera Cloud, invite a colleague, upload sample data, launch a workflow, and review the
results.

If you have not deployed Easy Genomics yet, complete [Prerequisites and Preparation](./prerequisites.md) and
[Installation](./install.md) first. **You do not need any other documentation to finish this guide.**

> **Production vs non-production:** On `env-type: dev` or `pre-prod`, deploy may seed a **Default Organization**, test
> users, and a **Test Laboratory**. On **`prod`**, only the System Admin account is created—you must create an
> organization yourself. This guide follows a greenfield path (create org + lab) so it works for production; skip
> organization creation if your environment already has one you plan to use.

## Before you start

Collect the following before you begin:

| Item                                                                                                    | Where it comes from                                                                                                                                         |

## 1. First login and account verification

### Sign in as System Admin

1. Open **`{ApplicationUrl}/signin`** in your browser.
2. Enter the **System Admin** email and password from your `easy-genomics.yaml` configuration.
3. Choose **Sign in**.

![Sign in page](./assets/01-sign-in.png)

After a successful login you are taken to the home screen (System Admins may land on **Organizations**).

![Home after login](./assets/03-home-after-login.png)

### Account verification

**Deploy-created accounts** (System Admin and optional seeded test users on non-prod) are created in Amazon Cognito with
`email_verified` set and a permanent password. There is **no separate email confirmation step** for those accounts—you
can sign in immediately after deploy.

**Invited users** follow a different path:

1. An organization admin sends an invite (see [section 4](#4-invite-a-team-member-and-assign-a-role)).
2. The invitee opens the link in the invitation email and completes the **Accept invitation** form (first name, last
   name, password).
3. They are redirected to sign in with the invited email pre-filled:

![Sign in after accepting an invitation](./assets/02-sign-in-after-invite.png)

If your deployment enables Google single sign-in (`google-client-id` in `easy-genomics.yaml`), you may also use **Sign
in with Google** on the sign-in page.

---

## 2. Create an organization

Only a **System Admin** can create organizations.

1. Open **Organizations** from the top navigation.
2. Choose **Create a new Organization**.
3. Enter an **organization name** and **description**.
4. Optionally set the **Default Seqera Endpoint URL** (defaults to the value in `easy-genomics.yaml`, typically
   `https://api.cloud.seqera.io`).
5. Choose **Save changes**. You should see a toast: **Organization created**.

---

## 3. Create a laboratory

Sign in as an **Organization Admin** (sign out the System Admin first, or use your org-admin account).

1. Open **Labs** → **Create a new Lab**.
2. Fill in **Lab Name** and **Lab Description**.
3. Under **Default S3 bucket directory**, select the lab upload bucket created during deploy (non-prod environments
   provision a shared lab bucket automatically).
4. Connect your analysis platforms (you can enable **both** on one lab):

### Connect Seqera Cloud

1. Turn on **Enable Seqera Integration**.
2. Enter your Seqera **Workspace ID**.
3. Enter your Seqera **Personal Access Token** (stored securely; never shown again after save).
4. Confirm the **Seqera endpoint URL** (pre-filled from the organization).

![Create lab — Seqera integration](./assets/08-create-lab-seqera.png)

### Connect AWS HealthOmics

1. Turn on **Enable HealthOmics Integration**.
2. Enter a **GitHub Personal Access Token** when creating the lab (used to fetch workflow schemas from GitHub).

![Create lab — HealthOmics integration](./assets/09-create-lab-healthomics.png)

5. Choose **Create Lab**. You should see: **Successfully created Lab: …**

![Labs list](./assets/10-labs-list.png)

6. Open the lab → **Settings** to confirm integrations are enabled.

![Lab settings](./assets/11-lab-settings.png)

## 4. Invite a team member and assign a role

Organization Admins (and System Admins) manage membership at the organization level. Lab Managers can add existing org
members to a lab.

### Invite someone to the organization

1. **Organizations** → select your organization → **View / Edit**.
2. Open the **All users** tab.
3. Choose **Invite users**, enter an email address, and choose **Invite**.
4. The invitee receives an email with an activation link (see [section 1](#1-first-login-and-account-verification)).

![Invite users](./assets/06-invite-users.png)

### Assign organization and lab roles

1. On **All users**, open the row menu for a user → **Edit User Access**.
2. Toggle **Organization Admin** to grant org-wide admin rights.
3. In the lab table, use the role dropdown to assign **Lab Manager** or **Lab Technician** per lab.

![Edit user access](./assets/07-edit-user-access.png)

### Add a user to a lab

For users who are already in the organization but not yet on a lab:

1. Open the lab → **Users** tab.
2. Choose **Add Lab Users**, select the user, and choose **Add**.

![Lab users tab](./assets/12-lab-users.png)

| Role                   | Can create labs | Can invite org users | Can launch runs             |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Organization Admin** | Yes             | Yes                  | Yes (with lab access)       |
| **Lab Manager**        | No              | No                   | Yes                         |
| **Lab Technician**     | No              | No                   | Yes (limited by lab policy) |

---

## 5. Upload sample data

Lab Managers and Organization Admins with lab access can upload data and launch runs. The run wizard requests a **file
upload manifest** (presigned S3 URLs), uploads your FASTQ files, then generates a **sample sheet CSV** automatically.
You can optionally upload a custom sample sheet instead; this guide uses the default auto-generated path.

The upload steps are **the same for Seqera and HealthOmics**; only the lab tab you start from differs.

> **Alternative — Data Collections:** You can also import and organize samples on the lab **Data Collections** tab,
> build a **Sequence Collection**, then **Launch Workflow** (the run wizard opens with the collection’s sample sheet
> already generated). See [Data Collections](./data-collections.md).

### Shared upload steps

1. Open your lab.
2. Choose a platform tab — **Seqera Pipelines** or **HealthOmics Workflows** — and open the row menu for a
   pipeline/workflow → **Run**.
3. **Step 1 — Run details:** enter a unique **Run Name** → **Save & Continue**.

![Run name step](./assets/15-run-name.png)

4. **Step 2 — Upload data:**
   - Choose **Choose Files** and select your paired FASTQ files (R1 and R2).
   - Choose **Upload Files**. Easy Genomics requests an upload manifest, uploads files to your lab S3 prefix, then
     builds a sample sheet.
   - When upload completes, note the sample sheet S3 URL bar and **Download sample sheet**.

![Upload data step](./assets/16-upload-data.png)

![Files selected for upload](./assets/17-files-selected.png)

![Upload complete with sample sheet URL](./assets/18-upload-complete.png)

5. Choose **Next step** to continue to workflow parameters.

Example auto-generated sample sheet columns (your file names will differ):

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
NA1287820K,s3://your-bucket/org-id/lab-id/.../NA1287820K_R1_001.fastq.gz,s3://your-bucket/.../NA1287820K_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

## 6. Launch a workflow and monitor the run

The wizard has four steps: **Run details** → **Upload data** → **Parameters** → **Review & launch**. Parameter fields
such as `input` / `Input` and `outdir` are pre-filled from the sample sheet.

### Option A — Seqera Cloud

1. Open the lab → **Seqera Pipelines**.

![Seqera Pipelines tab](./assets/13-seqera-pipelines.png)

2. Row menu → **Run** (same upload steps as [section 5](#5-upload-sample-data)).
3. **Parameters:** review `input` / `outdir` (or **Input/output options**) → **Save & Continue**.

![Seqera parameters step](./assets/21-seqera-parameters.png)

4. **Review:** choose **Launch Pipeline Run**.
5. Choose **Back to Runs** to open **Pipeline Runs**.

![Seqera review and launch step](./assets/22-seqera-review-launch.png)

### Option B — AWS HealthOmics

1. Open the lab → **HealthOmics Workflows**.

![HealthOmics Workflows tab](./assets/14-omics-workflows.png)

2. Row menu → **Run** (same upload steps as [section 5](#5-upload-sample-data)).
3. **Parameters:** review **Input** and **outdir** → **Save & Continue**.

![HealthOmics parameters step](./assets/19-omics-parameters.png)

4. **Review:** choose **Launch Workflow Run**.
5. Choose **Back to Runs** to open **Pipeline Runs**.

![HealthOmics review and launch step](./assets/20-omics-review-launch.png)

### Monitor runs

1. Open the lab → **Pipeline Runs** (both platforms use this tab).
2. Find your run by name. New runs typically show status **Submitted** while Seqera Cloud or HealthOmics processes them.
3. Row menu → **View Details** for run metadata, platform badge (**Seqera Cloud** or **AWS HealthOmics**), sample sheet
   link, and status updates.

![Pipeline runs list](./assets/23-pipeline-runs-list.png)

![Run details](./assets/24-run-details.png)

Pipeline names in your environment depend on your Seqera workspace and HealthOmics account (for example
`quality-e2e-test-pipeline` on Seqera or `k-florek/workshop-main` on HealthOmics).

---

## 7. Read run results and download outputs

1. From **Run details**, open the **File Manager** tab.
2. Browse files under the run’s S3 prefix—input FASTQs, the generated `samplesheet-{runName}.csv`, and (as the external
   run completes) workflow outputs.
3. Use the download action on a file row. Your browser should show **Your files have begun downloading**.

![File Manager](./assets/25-file-manager.png)

Reports and final outputs from Seqera Cloud or HealthOmics appear in File Manager as the external run finishes. Refresh
the run details page to see updated status.

---

## What’s next

- **Organize lab data** — import samples, tags, and sequence collections on the
  [Data Collections](./data-collections.md) page, then launch workflows from a collection.
- **Pipeline authoring and configuration** — see [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/) and
  [Seqera Platform documentation](https://docs.seqera.io/).
- **Operational issues** — see [Troubleshooting](../operations/troubleshooting.md).

You have now completed the core Easy Genomics setup: organization, lab, integrations, team access, data upload, and a
first workflow run on Seqera Cloud and/or AWS HealthOmics.
