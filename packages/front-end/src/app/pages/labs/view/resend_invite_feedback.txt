Remember that the resend invite function might take some time due to API call, the ```useToastStore().success('Invite resent');``` call should probably be put in the .then() part of the API call to truly reflect that the invite is resent. Additionally, you might want to handle API errors, in such a case you could remove the uuid from the `disabledButtons` ref to enable the button again.
